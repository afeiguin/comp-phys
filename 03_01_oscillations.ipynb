    "The harmonic oscillator\n",
    "-----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that simple oscillatory motion is described by a general\n",
    "quadratic potential of the form $$V=\\frac{1}{2}kx^2,$$ where $k$ is a\n",
    "“force constant”. In a spring, this is a measure of the stiffness of the\n",
    "spring. In a pendulum, it is given by $$k=\\frac{mg}{L}$$ where $m$ is\n",
    "the mass of the particle and $L$ its length. From this potential we can\n",
    "extract the force $$F=-\\frac{dV}{dx}=-kx$$ and the equation of motion\n",
    "can be written as \n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\\omega _0 ^2x,\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where the quantity $\\omega _0$ is defined by\n",
    "$$\\omega _0=\\frac{k}{m}$$ The dynamical motion described by these\n",
    "equations is called “simple harmonic motion” and can be solved\n",
    "analytically: $$x(t)=A\\cos{(\\omega _0t+\\delta)},\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "where $a$ is the amplitude of th oscillations and\n",
    "$\\delta$ is a phase that depends on the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now define a period $T$ such as $$x(t+T)=x(t).$$ Since\n",
    "$\\omega _0T$ corresponds to one cycle, we obtain\n",
    "$$T=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\omega _0}=\\frac{2\\pi}{\\sqrt{k/m}}.$$ The frequency\n",
    "$\\nu$ is the number of cycles per unit of time and is given by\n",
    "$\\nu=1/T$. Note that the period of the motion depends on the ratio\n",
    "$k/m$ and is completely independent of the initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3.1: Energy conservation \n",
    "\n",
    "1.  In Exercise 1.6 we wrote program to simulate simple harmonic motion.\n",
    "    Now use the program to calculate the relative change in the total\n",
    "    energy during one cycle $\\Delta _n=(E_n-E_0)/E_0$. Is the function\n",
    "    $\\Delta$ uniformly small during the cycle? Choose $x_0=1$, $v_0=0$,\n",

    "\n",
    "3.  Compute the amplitude $A$ for the initial conditions $x_0=4$,\n",
    "    $v_0=0$, and $x_0=0$, $v_0=4$; choose $\\omega _0^2=4$ in both cases.\n",
    "    What quantity determines the value of $A$?.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Compute the average value of the kinetic energy and the potential\n",
    "    energy during a complete cycle. Is there a relation between the two\n",
    "    averages?\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Plot the path of the oscillator in phase space $(x,v)$. Set\n",
    "    $\\omega _0^2=9$ and use different initial conditions\n",
    "    $(x_0,v_0)=(1,0);(0,1);(4,0)$. Do you find different paths for each\n",
    "    of them? What physical quantity distinguishes or characterizes each\n",
    "    path? What is the shape of the phase paths? Is the motion of a\n",
    "    representative point $(x,v)$ always in the clockwise or\n",
    "    counterclockwise direction?\n",

    "### Exercise 3.2: Large oscillations \n",
    "\n",
    "The pendulum responds to the equation of motion for simple harmonic motion only in\n",
    "the limit of small angles. In the case of large oscillations, the\n",
    "equation has to be modified becoming\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2}=-\\frac{g}{L}\\sin{\\theta}.$$\n",

    "### Exercise 3.3: Damped oscillations \n",
    "\n",
    "If a drag force is included in the problem, the equation of motion\n",
    "becomes: $$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\\omega _0^2x-\\gamma \\frac{dx}{dt},$$ where\n",
    "the “damping coefficient” gamma is a measure of the friction. Note that\n",
    "the drag force opposes the motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Incorporate the effects of damping in your program and plot the time\n",
    "    dependece of position and velocity. Make runs for $\\omega _0^2=9$,\n",

    "    damping?\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Define the amplitude as the maximum value of $x$ in one cycle.\n",
    "    Compute the “relaxation time” $\\tau$, the time it takes for the\n",
    "    amplitude to change from its maximum to $1/e\\approx 0.37$ of its\n",
    "    maximum value. To do this, plot the maximum amplitud of each cycle,\n",

    "5.  Compute the average value of the kinetic energy, potential energy,\n",
    "    and total energy over a complete cycle. Plot these averages as a\n",
    "    function of the number of cycles. Due to the presence of damping,\n",
    "    these averages decrease with time. Is the decrease uniform?\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Compute the time-dependence of $x(t)$ and $v(t)$ for\n",

    "    is said to be “critically damped” at the smallest values of $\\gamma$\n",
    "    for which the decay to equilibrium is monotonic. For what value of\n",
    "    $\\gamma$ does critical damping occur for $\\omega_0^2=9$ and\n",

    "How can we determine the period of a pendulum that is not already in\n",
    "motion? The obvious way is to disturb the system, for instance, applying a\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider a damped linear oscillator with an external force $F(t)$\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}=-\\omega _0^2x-\\gamma\\frac{dx}{dt}+\\frac{1}{m}F(t).$$\n",
    "It is customary to interpret the reponse of the system in terms of the\n",
    "displacement $x$. The time dependence in $F(t)$ is arbitrary. A\n",
    "particular case is when the force is harmonic:\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{m}F(t)=A_0 \\cos{\\omega t},\n",
    "$$ where $\\omega$ is the angular frequency of the\n",
    "driving force.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Modify your program so that an external force of the form\n",

    "    $A_0=1$ and $\\omega = 2$ (we’ll use these values for the rest of\n",
    "    the exercise). These values correspond to a lightly\n",
    "    damped oscillator. Plot $x(t)$ versus $t$ for the initial conditions\n",

    "    after several oscillations? Obtain a similar plot with\n",
    "    $(x_0=0,v_0=1)$. What is the period and angular frequency after\n",
    "    several oscillations? Does $x(t)$ approach a limiting behavior that\n",
    "    is independent of the initial conditions? Identify a “transient”\n",
    "    part of $x(t)$ which depends on the initial conditions and decays in\n",
    "    time, and a “steady state” part which dominates at longer times and\n",
