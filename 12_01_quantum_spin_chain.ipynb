    "Obtaining the ground-state: Lanczos diagonalization\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a superblock matrix, we can apply a library routine to\n",
    "obtain the ground state of the superblock $|\\Psi\\rangle$. The two\n",
    "algorithms widely used for this purpose are the Lanczos and Davidson\n",
    "diagonalization. Both are explained to great extent in Ref.@noack, so we\n",
    "refer the reader to this material for further information. In these\n",
    "notes we will briefly explain the Lanczos procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the Lanczos method is that a special basis can be constructed\n",
    "where the Hamiltonian has a tridiagonal representation. This is carried\n",
    "out iteratively as shown below. First, it is necessary to select an\n",
    "arbitrary seed vector $|\\phi _{0}\\rangle $ in the Hilbert space of the\n",
    "model being studied. If we are seeking the ground-state of the model,\n",
    "then it is necessary that the overlap between the actual ground-state\n",
    "$|\\psi\n",
    "_{0}\\rangle $, and the initial state $|\\phi _{0}\\rangle $ be nonzero. If\n",
    "no “a priori” information about the ground state is known, this\n",
    "requirement is usually easily satisfied by selecting an initial state\n",
    "with *randomly* chosen coefficients in the working basis that is being\n",
    "used. If some other information of the ground state is known, like its\n",
    "total momentum and spin, then it is convenient to initiate the\n",
    "iterations with a state already belonging to the subspace having those\n",
    "quantum numbers (and still with random coefficients within this\n",
    "subspace).\n",
    "\n",
    "After $|\\phi _{0}\\rangle $ is selected, define a new vector by applying\n",
    "the Hamiltonian ${{\\hat{H}}}$, over the initial state. Subtracting the\n",
    "projection over $|\\phi _{0}\\rangle $, we obtain\n",
    "$$|\\phi _{1}\\rangle ={{\\hat{H}}}|\\phi _{0}\\rangle -\\frac{{\\langle }\\phi _{0}|{{%\n",
    "\\hat{H}}}|{\\phi }_{0}{\\rangle }}{\\langle \\phi _{0}|\\phi _{0}\\rangle }|\\phi\n",
    "_{0}\\rangle ,$$ that satisfies $\\langle \\phi _{0}|\\phi _{1}\\rangle =0$.\n",
    "Now, we can construct a new state that is orthogonal to the previous two\n",
    "as,\n",
    "$$|\\phi _{2}\\rangle ={{\\hat{H}}}|\\phi _{1}\\rangle -{\\frac{{\\langle \\phi _{1}|{%\n",

    "_{1}\\rangle -{\\frac{{\\langle \\phi _{1}|\\phi _{1}\\rangle }}{{\\langle \\phi\n",
    "_{0}|\\phi _{0}\\rangle }}}|\\phi _{0}\\rangle .$$ It can be easily checked\n",
    "that $\\langle \\phi _{0}|\\phi _{2}\\rangle\n",
    "=\\langle \\phi _{1}|\\phi _{2}\\rangle =0$. The procedure can be\n",
    "generalized by defining an orthogonal basis recursively as,\n",
    "$$|\\phi _{n+1}\\rangle ={{\\hat{H}}}|\\phi _{n}\\rangle -a_{n}|\\phi _{n}\\rangle\n",
    "-b_{n}^{2}|\\phi _{n-1}\\rangle ,$$ where $n=0,1,2,...$, and the\n",
    "coefficients are given by\n",
    "$$a_{n}={\\frac{{\\langle \\phi _{n}|{\\hat{H}}|\\phi _{n}\\rangle }}{{\\langle \\phi\n",
    "_{n}|\\phi _{n}\\rangle }}},\\qquad b_{n}^{2}={\\frac{{\\langle \\phi _{n}|\\phi\n",
    "_{n}\\rangle }}{{\\langle \\phi _{n-1}|\\phi _{n-1}\\rangle }}},$$\n",
    "supplemented by $b_{0}=0$, $|\\phi _{-1}\\rangle =0$. In this basis, it\n",
    "can be shown that the Hamiltonian matrix becomes, $$H=\\left(\n",
    "\\begin{array}{lllll}\n",

    "matrix can be diagonalized easily using standard library subroutines.\n",
    "However, note that to diagonalize completely a Hamiltonian on a finite\n",
    "cluster, a number of iterations equal to the size of the Hilbert space\n",
    "(or the subspace under consideration) are needed. In practice this would\n",
    "demand a considerable amount of CPU time. However, one of the advantages\n",

    "state of the problem can be obtained after a small number of iterations\n",
    "(typically of the order of $\\sim 100$ or less).\n",
